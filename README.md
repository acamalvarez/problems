# Problems
A Web site that shows three engineering-related problems that let modify parameters to see the changes on the result.

In the home page you can find a list of the avaible problems so far and you can look for keywords in the search box it has. The problems are:

## Calculation of pH
It calculates the pH of an aqueuous solutin at 25 Â°C. It allows you to enter the concentration of the solution and to select a compound from the dropdown.

## Gas reactions on PFR
This problem allows you to change the concentration and reaction constants of the compounds in a reaction taking place in plug flow reactor to see how those parameters affect the concentration of the compoounds at the exit of the reactor.

## Optimization of paints
This is an optimization problem in which you can change the cost of three paints and the cost of its ingredients to calculate the quantities to produce that minimize the production cost.
