# Problems
A Web site that shows three engineering-related problems that let modify parameters to see the changes on the result.

In the home page you can find a list of the avaible problems so far and you can look for keywords in the search box it has. The problems are:

-Calculation of pH: Allow you to enter the concentration of the solution and select a compound from the dropdown to calculate the pH af 25 Â°C.

-Gas reactions on PFR: Allow you to change the concentration and reaction constants to see how those parameters affect the concentration of the compoounds.

-Optimization of paints: This is an optimization problem in which you can change the cost of three paints and the cost of in ingredients to calculate the quantity to produce to minimize the production cost.
